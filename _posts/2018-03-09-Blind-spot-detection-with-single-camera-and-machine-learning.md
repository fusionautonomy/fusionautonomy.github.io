Blind spot detection is an important feature of ADAS. We developed a camera-based deep learning method that accurately detects other vehicles in the blind spot, replacing the traditional higher cost solution using radars. It transfers blind spot detection to an image classification task. Subsequently, a series of experiments are conducted to design an efficient neural network by comparing some of the latest deep learning models. Furthermore, we create a dataset with more than 10,000 labeled images using the blind spot view camera mounted on a test vehicle. Finally, we train the proposed deep learning model and evaluate its performance on the dataset.
