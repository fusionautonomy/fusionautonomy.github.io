Automatic detection of traffic lights has great importance to road safety. We developed a novel approach that combines computer vision and machine learning techniques for accurate detection and classification of different types of traffic lights, including green and red lights both in circular and arrow forms. When evaluated using the test video sequences, the proposed system can successfully detect the traffic lights on the scene with high accuracy and stable results. Considering hardware acceleration, we build an FPGA prototype that is ready to be integrated into ADAS or self-driving cars. We build our own dataset of traffic lights from recorded driving videos, including circular lights and arrow lights in different directions. Contact us if you are interested in acquiring our dataset.
